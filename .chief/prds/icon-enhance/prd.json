  "description": "Refine the programmatically generated app icon (generate_icon.swift) so the donut reads as a 3/4 circle with a realistic bite taken out of the upper-right, and the purple glazing sits as a narrower band that leaves the tan donut body visible on both inner and outer edges.",

      "description": "As a user, I want the app icon's donut to be a 3/4 circle with a realistic bite mark in the upper-right and a narrower glazing band, so the icon looks like an actual bitten donut with visible dough under the glaze.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The donut body covers approximately 270° of the full circle (3/4), with the missing quarter in the upper-right area",
        "The edges where the bite is taken are not clean straight cuts — they follow an irregular, tooth-mark-like scalloped or wavy contour to suggest a real bite",
        "The bite mark position remains in the upper-right, consistent with the current design intent",
        "The green gradient background is fully visible through the bitten-out area",
        "The purple glazing follows the same 3/4 arc shape as the donut body",
        "The glazing is visibly narrower than the donut ring, leaving a tan margin on both the inner and outer sides",
        "The glazing's purple gradient and any 3D highlight effects are preserved",
        "The bite-mark end of the glazing aligns with the bite-mark end of the donut body (no glazing floating past the bite)",
        "Sprinkles (on sizes ≥64px) sit on the narrower glazing band and don't overflow onto the tan edges",
        "The donut hole and background remain unchanged",
        "Icon renders correctly at all 10 generated sizes (16×16 through 512×512 @2x)",
        "Menu bar icon is not modified"
